#steps to run this project:

step1: first of all download nodejs on your system. go to the official website of Nodejs and download the latest version from it. and after downloading install it in
the sytem.and type node -v in cmd to check the version of installed node.

step2: you must have a code editor. so go to the official website of visual studio code and download it from there. after downloading install it in your system.

step3: Now come to github and download this project on clicking the download button.

step4: open this project in visual studio code. after that open the client folder into the terminal of the code editor.

step5: now run a command in the terminal.  npm i

step6: npm i command will install all the dependencies which is required to run the app.

step7: run npm start command in the terminal it will run the app on localhost:3000



#Knowledge required:
1.HTML
2.CSS
3.Javascript
4.ReactJs
5.server calls

the project is made by using ReactJs. in which i am using some of the basic to advance concept of Reactjs.
to understand the code first of all you should learn about the structure of the reactjs projects. how functional components works in reactJs? what are hooks in reactJs. 

You must have a good understanding of useEffect and useState hook.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
